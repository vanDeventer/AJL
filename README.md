The Arrowhead Framework Java Light (AJL, pronounced Ah-gel) is an educational projcet to learn about the Arrowhead Framework.
It is not a replacement for the [framework](https://github.com/arrowhead-f/core-java-spring), which is the real thing.
It is to be compatible so that one can use the existing systems to achieve concrete demonstrators with ease.

The Arrowhead Framework is an attempt to provide interoperability with cybersecurity when using the Internet, and its suite of protocols, to allow industrial machines to communicate with each other. 
It is not the only such attempt, there are several others, each with their own view to "the" solution.
At a more abstract levels, we can see national levels, we can find consortia that promote such efforts in an effort to make their industry more efficient.
For example, in Germany, one finds [Indusrie 4.0](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html), while in the US, there is the [Industrial Internet Consortium](https://www.iiconsortium.org).
One of the feature of the Arrowhead Framework is the local cloud, which among its advantage is manageability.

The Arrowhead Framework does not really care of the programming language the software (administrative shells) are written in.
What really matters are the messages and their sequence of exchange.
To help one navigate, one can use the [JavaDocs](JavaDocs/se/ltu/ajl/package-summary.html)
