# AJL
The Arrowhead Framework Java Light (AJL, pronounced Ah-gel) is an educational projcest to learn about the Arrowhead Framework.
It is not a replacement for the [framework](https://github.com/arrowhead-f/core-java-spring), which is the real thing.

The Arrowhead Framework is an attempt to provide interoperability with cybersecurity when using the Internet, and its suite of protocols, to allow industrial machines to communicate with each other. 
It is not the only such attempt, there are several others, each with their own view to "the" solution.
At a more abstract levels, we can see national levels, we can find consortia that promote such efforts in an effort to make their industry more efficient.
For example, in Germany, one finds [Indusrie 4.0](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html), while in the US, there is the [Industrial Internet Consortium](https://www.iiconsortium.org).
